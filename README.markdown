Legal
=====

**__Requires Zikula Core 1.5.0+__**

This module provides a site with the ability to manage and display legal information such as terms of use
and privacy policies. It also allows the site to require that these policies be accepted during registration
and/or log-in.

This module also supports a simplistic age verification during registration.
